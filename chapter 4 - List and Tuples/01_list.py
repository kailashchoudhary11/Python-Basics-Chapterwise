# We can create a list using [val1, val2, val3, etc.]
a = [1, 2, 4, 56, 6]

# We can print the list using the print statement 
# print(a)

# In list indexing starts from 0
# Accessing the elements in the list individually 
# print(a[0]) # prints the first element in the list 
# print(a[1]) # prints the second element in the list
# print(a[2]) # prints the third element in the list 

# print(a[5]) # This will give error as there are only 5 element in the list and so we cannot access the 6th element

# Lists are mutable that's why we can modify the elements in the list 
a[1] = 33 # This will modify the 2nd element in the list
# print(a)

# We can create a list with items of different data types 
c = [34, "kai", True, 99.33]
# print(c)
