# Syntax for creating a tuple 
t = (1, 2, 4, 5)

# Accessing the elements of the tuples individually 
# Indexing starts from 0. similar to list
# print(t[0])
# print(t[3])
# print(t[2])

# Tuples are immutable and hence the values in the tuple cannot be updated
# This is the major difference between list and tuple 
# t[2] = 33 # This will throw error 

# Creating an empty tuple 
# t0 = ()
# print(t0)

# t1 = (1) # This is the wrong way to declare a tuple with only one element 
# print(t1)
# t1 = (1, ) # This is the correct way to declare a tuple which consisits of only one element
# print(t1)
